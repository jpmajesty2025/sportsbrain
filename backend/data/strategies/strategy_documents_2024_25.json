By completely ignoring ft, you can focus on dominating the remaining \n            8 categories while your opponents waste resources trying to be competitive in all 9.\n            \n            **Why Punt FT%?**\n            Free throw percentage is concentrated among a small pool of players. By punting it, you gain access to elite players like Giannis, Gobert, and Simmons at a discount.\n            \n            **Core Build Philosophy:**\n            This build focuses on maximizing value in categories that typically oppose ft. \n            You'll be targeting players who excel everywhere except ft, which often makes them \n            undervalued in standard drafts.\n            \n            **Draft Strategy by Round:**\n            \n            **Round 1-2: Elite Foundation**\n            Target: Ben Simmons, Giannis Antetokounmpo\n            These players provide elite production across multiple categories while being weak in ft.\n            Their ft weakness actually becomes a strength in this build, as it doesn't hurt you \n            while providing elite value elsewhere.\n            \n            **Round 3-5: Core Contributors**\n            Target: Nic Claxton, Rudy Gobert, Jakob Poeltl\n            These players complement your elite picks perfectly. They maintain the punt while contributing \n            solid numbers in your target categories.\n            \n            **Round 6-9: Specialists**\n            Look for players who excel in 1-2 categories while being particularly weak in ft.\n            This is where you can find tremendous value as other managers avoid these \"flawed\" players.\n            \n            **Round 10+: Value Adds**\n            Target: Jalen Duren, Isaiah Stewart, Kevon Looney\n            Late-round players who fit the build and can provide streaming value or upside.\n            \n            **Categories You'll Dominate:**\n            FG%, REB, BLK, STL, TO\n            \n            **Categories to Monitor:**\n            PTS, AST, 3PM\n            \n            **Key Synergies:**\n            Ben Simmons + Giannis Antetokounmpo: Elite combo that perfectly complements each other\nBen Simmons + Nic Claxton: Strong pairing with excellent category coverage\n            \n            **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n            1. Don't accidentally draft good ft players out of habit\n            2. Don't panic if you're last in ft - that's the plan!\n            3. Don't trade for players who hurt your punt strategy\n            4. Don't overlook specialists who are elite in your target categories\n            \n            **Waiver Wire Strategy:**\n            Focus on streaming players who:\n            - Are terrible at ft (this is good!)\n            - Excel in your target categories\n            - Have favorable matchups for counting stats\n            - Get consistent minutes despite ft weakness\n            \n            **Trade Targets:**\n            Players to acquire: Those with poor ft but elite elsewhere\n            Players to trade away: Any accidental ft specialists you drafted\n            \n            **Success Metrics:**\n            - Winning 6-3 or better weekly\n            - Top 3 in your strong categories\n            - Dead last in ft (this means it's working!)\n            - Consistent week-to-week performance\n            \n            **Expert Tip:**\n            Don't be afraid to be DEAD LAST in FT%.

By completely ignoring fg, you can focus on dominating the remaining \n            8 categories while your opponents waste resources trying to be competitive in all 9.\n            \n            **Why Punt FG%?**\n            Field goal percentage allows you to load up on high-volume three-point shooters who provide elite scoring, threes, and assists.\n            \n            **Core Build Philosophy:**\n            This build focuses on maximizing value in categories that typically oppose fg. \n            You'll be targeting players who excel everywhere except fg, which often makes them \n            undervalued in standard drafts.\n            \n            **Draft Strategy by Round:**\n            \n            **Round 1-2: Elite Foundation**\n            Target: Damian Lillard, Trae Young\n            These players provide elite production across multiple categories while being weak in fg.\n            Their fg weakness actually becomes a strength in this build, as it doesn't hurt you \n            while providing elite value elsewhere.\n            \n            **Round 3-5: Core Contributors**\n            Target: Jordan Poole, Anfernee Simons, Cole Anthony\n            These players complement your elite picks perfectly. They maintain the punt while contributing \n            solid numbers in your target categories.\n            \n            **Round 6-9: Specialists**\n            Look for players who excel in 1-2 categories while being particularly weak in fg.\n            This is where you can find tremendous value as other managers avoid these \"flawed\" players.\n            \n            **Round 10+: Value Adds**\n            Target: Kevin Huerter, Bones Hyland, Malik Monk\n            Late-round players who fit the build and can provide streaming value or upside.\n            \n            **Categories You'll Dominate:**\n            FT%, 3PM, PTS, AST\n            \n            **Categories to Monitor:**\n            REB, BLK, STL\n            \n            **Key Synergies:**\n            Damian Lillard + Trae Young: Elite combo that perfectly complements each other\nDamian Lillard + Jordan Poole: Strong pairing with excellent category coverage\n            \n            **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n            1. Don't accidentally draft good fg players out of habit\n            2. Don't panic if you're last in fg - that's the plan!\n            3. Don't trade for players who hurt your punt strategy\n            4. Don't overlook specialists who are elite in your target categories\n            \n            **Waiver Wire Strategy:**\n            Focus on streaming players who:\n            - Are terrible at fg (this is good!)\n            - Excel in your target categories\n            - Have favorable matchups for counting stats\n            - Get consistent minutes despite fg weakness\n            \n            **Trade Targets:**\n            Players to acquire: Those with poor fg but elite elsewhere\n            Players to trade away: Any accidental fg specialists you drafted\n            \n            **Success Metrics:**\n            - Winning 6-3 or better weekly\n            - Top 3 in your strong categories\n            - Dead last in fg (this means it's working!)\n            - Consistent week-to-week performance\n            \n            **Expert Tip:**\n            Load up on volume three-point shooters.

Punting them lets you dominate traditional categories with old-school players.\n            \n            **Core Build Philosophy:**\n            This build focuses on maximizing value in categories that typically oppose 3pm. \n            You'll be targeting players who excel everywhere except 3pm, which often makes them \n            undervalued in standard drafts.\n            \n            **Draft Strategy by Round:**\n            \n            **Round 1-2: Elite Foundation**\n            Target: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jimmy Butler\n            These players provide elite production across multiple categories while being weak in 3pm.\n            Their 3pm weakness actually becomes a strength in this build, as it doesn't hurt you \n            while providing elite value elsewhere.\n            \n            **Round 3-5: Core Contributors**\n            Target: Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons, DeMar DeRozan\n            These players complement your elite picks perfectly. They maintain the punt while contributing \n            solid numbers in your target categories.\n            \n            **Round 6-9: Specialists**\n            Look for players who excel in 1-2 categories while being particularly weak in 3pm.\n            This is where you can find tremendous value as other managers avoid these \"flawed\" players.\n            \n            **Round 10+: Value Adds**\n            Target: Clint Capela, Nic Claxton, Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas\n            Late-round players who fit the build and can provide streaming value or upside.\n            \n            **Categories You'll Dominate:**\n            FG%, REB, BLK, FT%\n            \n            **Categories to Monitor:**\n            AST, STL, PTS\n            \n            **Key Synergies:**\n            Giannis Antetokounmpo + Jimmy Butler: Elite combo that perfectly complements each other\nGiannis Antetokounmpo + Russell Westbrook: Strong pairing with excellent category coverage\n            \n            **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n            1. Don't accidentally draft good 3pm players out of habit\n            2. Don't panic if you're last in 3pm - that's the plan!\n            3. Don't trade for players who hurt your punt strategy\n            4. Don't overlook specialists who are elite in your target categories\n            \n            **Waiver Wire Strategy:**\n            Focus on streaming players who:\n            - Are terrible at 3pm (this is good!)\n            - Excel in your target categories\n            - Have favorable matchups for counting stats\n            - Get consistent minutes despite 3pm weakness\n            \n            **Trade Targets:**\n            Players to acquire: Those with poor 3pm but elite elsewhere\n            Players to trade away: Any accidental 3pm specialists you drafted\n            \n            **Success Metrics:**\n            - Winning 6-3 or better weekly\n            - Top 3 in your strong categories\n            - Dead last in 3pm (this means it's working!)\n            - Consistent week-to-week performance\n            \n            **Expert Tip:**\n            Target players from the 90s/00s era playing style.

Don't trade for players who hurt your punt strategy\n            4. Don't overlook specialists who are elite in your target categories\n            \n            **Waiver Wire Strategy:**\n            Focus on streaming players who:\n            - Are terrible at reb (this is good!)\n            - Excel in your target categories\n            - Have favorable matchups for counting stats\n            - Get consistent minutes despite reb weakness\n            \n            **Trade Targets:**\n            Players to acquire: Those with poor reb but elite elsewhere\n            Players to trade away: Any accidental reb specialists you drafted\n            \n            **Success Metrics:**\n            - Winning 6-3 or better weekly\n            - Top 3 in your strong categories\n            - Dead last in reb (this means it's working!)\n            - Consistent week-to-week performance\n            \n            **Expert Tip:**\n            Go all-in on guard stats.
