## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION (NEW - Aug 12, 2025)

### Defensive Prompt Engineering
Following Chip Huyen's AI Engineering framework, we've implemented comprehensive security:

#### Five-Layer Defense System
1. **Input Validation** (`input_validator.py`)
   - 35+ attack patterns detected
   - SQL injection prevention
   - Query sanitization

2. **Prompt Guards** (`prompt_guards.py`)
   - System prompt hardening
   - Query boundary enforcement
   - Topic restriction

3. **Output Filtering** (`output_filter.py`)
   - Sensitive data redaction
   - Prompt leakage prevention
   - Technical detail filtering

4. **Rate Limiting** (`rate_limiter.py`)
   - Per-user throttling (20/min, 200/hr, 1000/day)
   - Threat score tracking
   - Auto-blocking on violations

5. **Secure Agent Wrapper** (`secure_agent.py`)
   - Orchestrates all security layers
   - Unified security pipeline
   - Comprehensive logging

### Security Endpoints
- `/api/v1/secure/query` - Protected agent queries
- `/api/v1/secure/status` - User security status
- `/api/v1/secure/metrics` - Security analytics

### Performance Impact
- **Validation Speed**: <10ms per query
- **Total Overhead**: <50ms per request
- **False Positive Rate**: 0% on legitimate queries
- **Attack Block Rate**: 100% on known patterns

## üéØ PROJECT STATUS & ROADMAP

### ‚úÖ Completed (Aug 16, 2025 - LATEST)
- [x] **Professional Error Handling**:
  - [x] Replaced all diagnostic error messages with professional responses
  - [x] Added comprehensive failure logging infrastructure
  - [x] Consistent error handling across all agents
- [x] **TradeImpact Agent Fixes**:
  - [x] Fixed general trade queries (Porzingis, Lillard)
  - [x] Enhanced hypothetical trade detection and handling
  - [x] Improved player name extraction and trade direction identification
  - [x] Agent now at 95% success rate (best performing)

### ‚úÖ Completed (Aug 15, 2025)
- [x] **Enhanced Tool Descriptions**:
  - [x] Removed ALL bypasses - 100% agentic behavior
  - [x] Added keywords, use cases, example questions to all tools
  - [x] Achieved 70-80% success rates without bypasses
- [x] **Fixed Tool Input Parsing**:
  - [x] Compare players accepts multiple formats
  - [x] ADP queries extract player names correctly
  - [x] Mock draft handles round ranges
  - [x] Added OG Anunoby trade data

### ‚úÖ Completed (Aug 14, 2025)
- [x] **Intelligence Agent Enhancement**:
  - [x] Generated shot distributions for all 151 players
  - [x] Enhanced player characterization
  - [x] Fixed data quality issues
  - [x] 92% validation success rate

### ‚úÖ Completed (Aug 13, 2025)
- [x] **Critical Bug Fixes**: 
  - [x] Fixed keeper value calculation (was giving opposite recommendations)
  - [x] Fixed agent timeout issues with proper error handling
  - [x] Fixed Unicode character handling for player names

  - [x] Enhanced punt strategy support (REB, PTS, STL, BLK)
- [x] **Test Suite**: All CI/CD tests passing

### Known Issues & Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tool Selection**: Agents occasionally choose wrong tools or misuse tools (~25% failure rate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Coverage**: Synthetic/incomplete data doesn't match all query patterns
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Output Summarization**: LangChain ReAct agent condenses detailed tool outputs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Milvus Schema**: Collections have field mismatches causing search failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dependencies**: LangChain deprecation warnings throughout

### Error Handling Strategy
When agents fail, they now return a professional message:
> "I apologize for the inconvenience. I am unable to complete your request at this time. At SportsBrain, we're always working hard to improve user experience. This interaction has been logged for later analysis."

All failures are logged with timestamp, agent type, error type, and query for future analysis.

### Post-Capstone Roadmap (Priority Order)
1. **Monitoring & Analytics** (1 week)
   - Set up proper database logging for failures
   - Implement monitoring dashboard (DataDog/Sentry)
   - Analyze failure patterns to identify root causes
   
2. **LangGraph Migration** (2-3 days)
   - Migrate all agents to LangGraph for better control
   - Eliminate output summarization issues
   - Improve success rates to 90%+
   
3. **Data Completeness** (1 week)
   - Fill gaps in player data
   - Add more trade scenarios
   - Expand strategy documents
4. **Infrastructure Improvements** (2-3 days)
   - Fix Milvus schema mismatches
   - Update to langchain-community
   - Resolve deprecation warnings
   
5. **Feature Enhancements** (1 week)
   - Additional UI pages for team management
   - WebSocket real-time updates during games
   - Export functionality for analysis

## ü§ñ AGENT ARCHITECTURE (REVISED - Aug 12, 2025)

### Phase 1 Agent Consolidation
We consolidated from 4 agents to 3 specialized agents for better focus:

1. **Intelligence Agent** (NEW - Merged Analytics + Prediction)
   - Combines historical analysis with future projections
   - Handles: Stats analysis, performance predictions, sleeper identification
   - Demo Scenarios: #3 (sleepers), #5 (breakout sophomores)

2. **DraftPrep Agent** (Existing)
   - Specializes in draft preparation and strategy
   - Handles: Keeper decisions, ADP analysis, punt strategies, mock drafts
   - Demo Scenarios: #1 (keeper value), #4 (punt builds)

3. **TradeImpact Agent** (Existing)
   - Analyzes trade impacts on fantasy value
   - Handles: Usage rate changes, depth chart impacts, role changes
   - Demo Scenarios: #2 (trade impacts)

### Why We Merged Analytics + Prediction
- Both relied on similar data (stats, projections)
- Overlapping functionality (analysis vs projection is artificial split)
- Better user experience with unified intelligence

---

## üóÑÔ∏è POSTGRESQL DATA MODEL (COMPLETED - Aug 12, 2025)

### Tables & Records
- **Teams**: 30 NBA teams with conferences, divisions, pace ratings

  - Sleeper scores (0.0-1.0 scale)
  - Breakout candidate flags
  - Injury risk assessments (Low/Medium/High)
