### ðŸ”„ CURRENT PRIORITIES (Phase 1A - Draft Prep Focus)
1. **Vector Database Population** (Next Step)
   - Load 1000+ player embeddings into Milvus
   - Create draft strategy embeddings
   - Index trade news and Reddit discussions
2. **Three Focused Agents** (Off-Season Value)
   - DraftPrep Agent: Mock drafts, ADP analysis, keeper decisions
   - TradeImpact Agent: Off-season move analysis
   - ProjectionAnalyst Agent: 2024-25 season predictions
3. **Graph Relationships**
   - Player â†’ Team (current & previous)
   - Trade â†’ Affected Players
   - Player â†’ Similar Players
4. **Data Integration**
   - Historical NBA stats (complete 2023-24 season)
   - Reddit r/fantasybball API
   - Mock draft data

### ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT STATUS

- **Backend API**: https://sportsbrain-backend-production.up.railway.app/
- **Services Running**: 
  - Frontend: âœ… Login page accessible
  - Backend: âœ… Health checks passing
  - PostgreSQL: âœ… Connected
  - Redis: âœ… Connected
  - Milvus: ðŸ”„ Credentials configured, awaiting data
  - Neo4j: ðŸ”„ Credentials configured, awaiting data
- **Monitoring**: `/health/detailed` shows all service statuses

## Phase 1A: Off-Season Draft Prep Focus
**Why Off-Season**: August is peak draft prep time - perfect for demo!
**Value Prop**: "Win your draft with AI-powered analysis"

### Three Core Agents (Simplified from 6)
1. **DraftPrep Agent**
   - Mock draft optimization
   - Keeper league decisions
   - Punting strategy recommendations
   - ADP vs projected value analysis

2. **TradeImpact Agent**
   - Analyze off-season trades (Lillard, Porzingis, etc.)
   - Usage rate projections
   - Team chemistry impacts
   
3. **ProjectionAnalyst Agent**
   - 2024-25 season predictions
   - Breakout candidate identification
   - Age curve analysis
   - Injury recovery timelines

## Milvus Collections (Dense Embeddings)
1. **sportsbrain_players**: Player profiles, stats, playing styles
2. **sportsbrain_strategies**: Draft strategies, punting guides
3. **sportsbrain_trades**: Trade analyses, Reddit discussions

## Data Sources (Phase 1A)
- **Historical Stats**: Complete 2023-24 season data
- **Reddit API**: r/fantasybball off-season discussions
- **Mock Draft Data**: ADP trends, expert rankings
- **Trade News**: 2024 off-season moves

## Key Demo Scenarios (August-Specific)
1. **"Should I keep Ja Morant in round 3?"** - Keeper value analysis
2. **"How does Porzingis trade affect Tatum?"** - Trade impact analysis  
3. **"Find me sleepers like last year's Sengun"** - Pattern matching
4. **"Best punt FT% build around Giannis"** - Strategy optimization
5. **"Which sophomores will break out?"** - Projection analysis

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: pytest suite for backend functionality (backend/tests/)
- **Integration Tests**: Automated deployment verification (test_deployment.py)
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time service health checks with database/Redis connectivity
- **CI/CD Testing**: Automated testing on every push with deployment verification
- **Manual Testing**: Interactive testing script (test_deployment_manual.py)
- **Performance Testing**: Response time verification (<3s requirement)
- **CORS Testing**: Cross-origin request validation for frontend-backend communication

## Phase 1 Testing Strategy (2-Week Capstone Focus)

### Current Testing Implementation
- **Model Testing**: Core data models, relationships, Phase 1A enhancements
- **API Testing**: Health checks, authentication, CRUD operations, future endpoint structure
- **Agent Testing**: Multi-agent coordination, workflow patterns, error handling
- **Deployment Testing**: All 4 services connectivity, health monitoring, performance validation
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing on every commit with deployment verification

### Testing Architecture (Pragmatic Approach)
- **Unit Tests (60%)**: Core logic, models, APIs, agent behaviors
- **Integration Tests (35%)**: Deployment verification, CI/CD pipeline, service orchestration  
- **E2E Tests (5%)**: Production health validation, manual verification tools

### Phase 1 Success Metrics
- âœ… **Deployment Success**: 100% automated deployment success rate
- âœ… **Response Time**: <3s for web endpoints
- âœ… **Test Coverage**: >70% for core business logic
- âœ… **Service Health**: All 4 services running and connected
- ðŸ”„ **Vertical Slice**: One complete feature (community OR personalization)

## Commands for Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
cd backend && pytest tests/ -v

# Test specific areas
pytest tests/test_models.py -v          # Data layer
pytest tests/test_api.py -v             # API layer
pytest tests/test_agent_behaviors.py -v # Agent logic
pytest tests/test_deployment.py -v      # Integration

# Manual deployment testing
python test_deployment_manual.py

# CI/CD pipeline runs all tests automatically on push to master
```
