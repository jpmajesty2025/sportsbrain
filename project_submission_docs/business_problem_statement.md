# SportsBrain: Business Problem Statement

## Executive Summary
SportsBrain addresses the critical challenge faced by millions of fantasy basketball players: **making optimal decisions in an information-rich but insight-poor environment**. While data about NBA players is abundant, transforming this data into actionable fantasy basketball strategies requires expertise, time, and analytical capabilities that most players lack.

## The Problem

- **Complex interactions** between player performances and team dynamics

### 2. Decision Complexity
Fantasy basketball managers face critical decisions with significant consequences:
- **Draft Preparation**: Which players to target in which rounds?
- **Keeper Decisions**: Is a player worth keeping at their cost?
- **Trade Evaluation**: How will roster moves impact team performance?
- **Strategy Optimization**: Which categories to punt for maximum advantage?

### 3. Time Constraints
- **Limited preparation time** before drafts
- **Quick decision requirements** during live drafts
