# SportsBrain Capstone Project Write-Up

## 1. Project Purpose and Expected Outcomes

### Purpose
SportsBrain is an AI-powered fantasy basketball intelligence platform designed to help fantasy managers make data-driven decisions during both the off-season draft preparation and in-season management. The platform leverages advanced AI technologies including dual RAG implementations (both vector and graph-based retrieval), multi-database architectures, and multi-agent systems to provide personalized insights that traditional fantasy platforms cannot offer.

### Problem Statement
Fantasy basketball success requires analyzing vast amounts of data across multiple dimensions:
- Player statistics and projections
- Team dynamics and trade impacts
- League-specific scoring settings
- Draft strategies and keeper valuations
- Real-time injury and rotation changes

Most fantasy managers lack the time and tools to synthesize this information effectively, leading to suboptimal decisions that cost them championships.

### Project Timing and Scope
An important consideration for this project was the timing of development. The project was completed in July-August 2025, while the 2025-26 NBA season doesn't begin until October. This timing naturally influenced our implementation focus:

- **Off-Season Emphasis**: We prioritized features most relevant during the off-season, such as draft preparation, keeper decisions, and trade impact analysis
- **Historical Analysis**: Without live games to track, we focused on historical data analysis and projection models
- **Synthetic Data**: Rather than attempting to build a full draft or season simulator (which would have been unrealistic in our timeframe), we used synthesized data to demonstrate platform capabilities
- **Foundation Building**: This timing allowed us to build a robust foundation that can be enhanced with real-time features once the season begins

This strategic focus on off-season activities aligns perfectly with when fantasy managers need the most help - during draft preparation and keeper decisions - while laying the groundwork for in-season features to be added when live data becomes available.

### Expected Outcomes
The platform delivers three core intelligent agents that work together to provide comprehensive fantasy basketball intelligence:

1. **Intelligence Agent**: Provides analytical insights and predictions
   - Identifies sleeper candidates with breakout potential
   - Analyzes player performance trends and projections
   - Compares players across multiple statistical dimensions
   - Generates data-driven recommendations based on historical patterns

2. **DraftPrep Agent**: Optimizes draft and keeper decisions
   - Calculates keeper values based on ADP vs. keeper round
   - Builds punt strategy teams optimized for specific categories
   - Provides mock draft recommendations for any draft position
   - Analyzes ADP trends to identify value picks

3. **TradeImpact Agent**: Evaluates trade scenarios and impacts
   - Projects usage rate changes from trades
   - Analyzes fantasy value shifts for all affected players
   - Provides trade recommendations based on team needs
   - Evaluates both completed and hypothetical trades

### Success Metrics
- **Query Response Accuracy**: 70-80% success rate across all agents
- **Data Coverage**: 1,007 vector embeddings (exceeding 1,000 requirement)
- **Response Time**: Acceptable for interactive use (formal benchmarking planned)
- **User Experience**: Professional error handling and intuitive interface
- **Security**: 5-layer defensive AI implementation preventing prompt injection

## 2. Datasets and Technology Stack Choices

### Data Sources

#### Real Data: NBA Stats API
- **What It Is**: Actual player and team data pulled from the official NBA Stats API
- **Scale**: 572 real NBA player profiles, 30 NBA teams
- **Where It's Stored**:
  - **PostgreSQL**: 30 teams table, base player data for 151 fantasy-relevant players
  - **Milvus**: 572 player embeddings in vector database
  - **Neo4j**: 572 player nodes with team relationships
- **What We Used It For**:
  - Player names, positions, teams, physical attributes
  - Team rosters, conferences, divisions
  - Foundation for all player-related features
- **Justification**: Provides authentic foundation with real NBA players and teams across all databases

#### Synthetic Data: Created for Demonstration
Since we developed during the off-season (July-August 2025) with no live games, we created synthetic data to demonstrate platform capabilities:

**Fantasy-Specific Data (PostgreSQL)**
- **What We Created**: 
  - ADP rankings for 151 fantasy-relevant players (subset of the 572)
  - Keeper round values (simulating where players were drafted)
  - Punt strategy fits (boolean flags for different punt builds)
  - Sleeper scores (0.0-1.0 scale indicating breakout potential)
- **How Created**: Manually assigned based on typical fantasy patterns

**Game Statistics (PostgreSQL)**
- **What We Created**: 100 synthetic games with 20 having detailed player statistics
- **How Created**: Python scripts generating realistic stat lines based on player positions and roles
- **Why Synthetic Instead of Real Historical Data?**: 
  - The NBA API does provide extensive historical game data through endpoints like `playergamelogs`, `boxscoretraditionalv2`, and `leaguegamelog`
  - However, we chose synthetic data for several strategic reasons:
    1. **Controlled Testing**: Synthetic data allowed us to create specific scenarios to test all agent capabilities
    2. **Fantasy Focus**: Real game logs don't include fantasy-specific calculations (keeper values, punt fits)
    3. **Time Efficiency**: Pulling and processing thousands of historical games would have consumed significant development time better spent on agent features
    4. **Demonstration Clarity**: Simplified data makes it easier to demonstrate core functionality without overwhelming complexity
    5. **Forward-Looking**: Since our focus is on the 2025-26 season, historical 2024-25 data would need projection adjustments anyway
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the system's ability to analyze game data; can easily switch to real data when season begins

**Projections and Analytics**
- **What We Created**:
  - 2025-26 season projections (PPG, RPG, APG, etc.) for 151 players
  - Shot distribution profiles (3PT%, midrange%, paint%) based on playing style
  - Consistency ratings and injury risk assessments
- **How Created**: Statistical formulas using position averages and playing style modifiers
- **Example**: A "Scorer" point guard gets higher PPG projection, more 3PT attempts

**Strategy Documents (Milvus)**
- **What We Created**: 230 strategy documents for RAG retrieval
- **How Created**: Generated text combining fantasy basketball concepts with player names
- **Purpose**: Enables semantic search for strategies like "punt FT% build" or "sleeper wings"

### Technology Stack
