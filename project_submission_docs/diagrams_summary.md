- **Key Components**:
  - User authentication and preferences
  - 151 players with positions and teams
  - 30 NBA teams with conference/division data
  - 200 games with scores and metadata
  - 480 game statistics records
  - 151 fantasy data records with projections and punt fits
- **Relationships**: Foreign key relationships between players, teams, games, and stats

#### Milvus Vector Collections Model (`milvus_collections_model.mermaid`)
- **Purpose**: Illustrates vector database collections for similarity search
- **Key Components**:
  - sportsbrain_players: 572 player embeddings
  - sportsbrain_strategies: 230 strategy documents
  - sportsbrain_trades: 205 trade analyses
  - Total: 1,007 embeddings (exceeds 1,000 requirement)
- **Technical Details**: 768-dimensional vectors using SentenceTransformer

#### Neo4j Graph Model (`neo4j_graph_model.mermaid`)
- **Purpose**: Shows graph database nodes and relationships
- **Key Components**:
  - Player nodes with fantasy stats
  - Team nodes with pace ratings
  - Trade and Strategy nodes
  - Relationships: PLAYS_FOR, TRADED_TO, FITS_STRATEGY, SYNERGIZES_WITH
- **Status**: Partially implemented with room for expansion

### 2. System Architecture Diagram (`system_architecture.mermaid`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive view of the implemented system
- **Layers**:
  - Client Layer: React frontend with Material-UI
  - API Gateway: FastAPI with authentication
  - Agent Layer: 3 LangChain agents with 17 total tools
  - Security Layer: 5-layer defensive AI implementation
  - Data Layer: PostgreSQL, Redis, Milvus, Neo4j
  - External Services: OpenAI API, NBA Stats API
  - Deployment: Railway, Zilliz Cloud, Neo4j Aura

### 3. Data Flow Diagram (`data_flow_diagram.mermaid`)
- **Purpose**: Shows how data moves through the system
- **Key Flows**:
  - Data ingestion from NBA Stats API and fantasy platforms
  - Quality checks and transformation pipeline
  - Storage distribution across databases
  - Query flow from user through security to agents
  - Tool execution and response generation
  - Cache layer for performance optimization

### 4. Business Problem Statement (`business_problem_statement.md`)
- **Purpose**: Articulates the problem SportsBrain solves
- **Key Points**:
  - Addresses information overload in fantasy basketball
  - Democratizes access to expert-level analysis
  - Serves 10+ million potential users
  - $12-24 million revenue potential at 1% market penetration
  - Clear competitive advantages through AI innovation

## How to View Mermaid Diagrams

The `.mermaid` files can be viewed in several ways:

1. **GitHub**: Automatically renders mermaid diagrams in markdown files
2. **VS Code**: Install "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
3. **Online**: Use https://mermaid.live/ and paste the diagram code
4. **Export**: Convert to PNG/SVG using mermaid-cli

## Diagram Highlights

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All three databases are documented
- **Implementation Focus**: Shows what was actually built, not just planned
- **Technical Accuracy**: Reflects real data counts and relationships
- **Professional Quality**: Industry-standard diagramming notation
- **Clear Labeling**: Each component is properly annotated

These diagrams fulfill the Capstone Project Spec requirements for system design documentation and provide a clear visual understanding of the SportsBrain architecture.
