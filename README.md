## üöÄ Live Demo Scenarios

Try these queries in our [live demo](https://sportsbrain-frontend-production.up.railway.app/):

### 1. Keeper Value Analysis
**Query**: "Should I keep Ja Morant in round 3?"

**Expected Response**:
```
Keeper Analysis: Ja Morant
‚Ä¢ Current ADP: Round 2
‚Ä¢ Keeper Cost: Round 3
‚Ä¢ Value: GOOD VALUE (+1 round discount)
‚Ä¢ Recommendation: KEEP
‚Ä¢ Reasoning: You're getting a Round 2 player in Round 3, which saves
  draft capital to invest elsewhere. Good foundation for a balanced build.
```

### 2. Trade Impact Assessment
**Query**: "How does the Porzingis trade affect Tatum?"

**Expected Response**:
```
Trade Impact Analysis: Jayson Tatum
‚Ä¢ Usage Rate Change: +2.5% projected increase
‚Ä¢ Fantasy Impact: +2.0 FP/game increase
‚Ä¢ Key Factor: Porzingis' high usage rate creates opportunities
‚Ä¢ Team Dynamic: Larger offensive role with roster changes
‚Ä¢ Overall Impact: POSITIVE - Tatum's fantasy value expected to improve
```

### 3. Sleeper Identification
**Query**: "Find sleeper centers like Alperen Sengun"

**Expected Response**:
```
Sleeper Centers Similar to Alperen Sengun:

‚Ä¢ Daniel Gafford (DAL): ADP #111, 24.2 FP/game
‚Ä¢ Naz Reid (MIN): ADP #149, 23.8 FP/game  
‚Ä¢ Isaiah Stewart (DET): ADP #107, 19.5 FP/game

Key Traits:
‚Ä¢ Late-round value (ADP 100+)
‚Ä¢ Upside potential similar to Sengun's breakout
‚Ä¢ Strong per-minute production
```

### 4. Punt Strategy Builder
**Query**: "Build me a punt FT% team around Giannis"

**Expected Response**:
```
Punt FT% Build (Targeting FG%, REB, BLK):

Round 1: Giannis Antetokounmpo (locked)
Round 2: Rudy Gobert - Elite FG% (70.5%), 12.9 REB, 2.1 BLK
Round 3: Domantas Sabonis - Double-double machine, 64% FG
Round 4: Clint Capela - FG% specialist, defensive anchor
Round 5: Jarrett Allen - Rim protection, 67% FG

Category Gains:
‚Ä¢ FG%: +15% advantage
‚Ä¢ REB: +20% advantage  
‚Ä¢ BLK: +25% advantage
‚Ä¢ Weakness: FT% (punt), 3PM (below average)
```

### 5. Breakout Sophomore Analysis

**Expected Response**:
```
Top Sophomore Breakout Candidates:

1. Paolo Banchero (PF/SF, Orlando)
   ‚Ä¢ Projection: 20.0 ‚Üí 24.5 PPG
   ‚Ä¢ Usage increase with Wagner as #2
   ‚Ä¢ Comparison: Jayson Tatum year 2 trajectory

2. Chet Holmgren (C/PF, Oklahoma City)
   ‚Ä¢ Unique skillset: 3.0 BPG + 37% 3PT
   ‚Ä¢ Fresh legs (missed rookie year)
   ‚Ä¢ Thunder's improved pace benefits his game
