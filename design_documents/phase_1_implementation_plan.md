# SportsBrain Phase 1 Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on delivering a working MVP without the complex multi-agent system. The goal is to have a functional fantasy basketball assistant that users can interact with.

## Core Features for Phase 1

### 1. User Authentication (Priority: HIGH)
- [x] JWT authentication backend (already implemented)
- [ ] User registration endpoint
- [ ] Frontend login/logout flow
- [ ] Protected routes in React
- [ ] User profile page

### 2. Player Data & Stats Display (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] NBA Stats API integration or mock data
- [ ] Player list view with basic stats (PPG, RPG, APG)
- [ ] Player detail page with full stats
- [ ] Search and filter players by position/team
- [ ] Recent game performance display

### 3. Simple Recommendations (Priority: MEDIUM)
Instead of complex multi-agent system, implement rule-based recommendations:
- [ ] Basic scoring algorithm based on:
  - Recent performance (last 5 games)
  - Season averages
  - Opponent matchup difficulty (simple rating)
  - Injury status (if available)
- [ ] "Start/Sit" recommendations
- [ ] Top performers by position
- [ ] Weekly lineup suggestions

### 4. User Experience (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Dashboard with quick stats
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Loading states and error handling
- [ ] Basic data visualization (charts for player trends)

## Implementation Steps

### Week 1: Foundation
1. **Day 1-2: Authentication**
   - Complete user registration endpoint
   - Test full auth flow with frontend
   - Add auth guards to React routes

2. **Day 3-4: Player Data**
   - Set up player data source (API or seed data)
   - Create player list and detail endpoints
   - Build React components for player display

3. **Day 5-7: Basic Recommendations**
   - Implement simple scoring algorithm
   - Create recommendation endpoints
   - Build recommendation UI components

### Week 2: Polish & Deploy
1. **Day 8-9: Search & Filters**
   - Add player search functionality
   - Implement position/team filters
   - Add sorting options

2. **Day 10-11: User Preferences**
   - Store user's favorite players
   - Save lineup history
   - Basic preference settings

3. **Day 12-14: Testing & Refinement**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixes and polish
   - Final deployment

## Simplified Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
    ├── Auth Components (Login/Register)
    ├── Player Components (List/Detail/Search)
    ├── Recommendation Components
    └── Dashboard

Backend (FastAPI)
    ├── Auth Endpoints (/auth/*)
    ├── Player Endpoints (/players/*)
    ├── Recommendation Endpoints (/recommendations/*)
    └── User Preference Endpoints (/users/*)

Database (PostgreSQL)
    ├── Users Table
    ├── Players Table (with stats)
    ├── Games Table
    ├── User Preferences Table
    └── User Lineups Table
```

## Data Sources Options

### Option 1: Mock Data (Fastest)
- Pre-populate database with sample players
- Generate realistic stats
- Focus on UX and features

### Option 2: NBA Stats API (More Realistic)
- Use official NBA Stats API
- Real-time data updates
- Requires API integration work

### Option 3: Web Scraping (Backup)
- Scrape from ESPN or similar
- More complex but free
- Consider rate limiting

## Success Criteria
1. Users can register and log in
2. Users can view NBA player stats
3. Users get simple start/sit recommendations
4. Application is deployed and accessible
5. Mobile-friendly interface
6. Response time < 2 seconds

## Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 1)
- Multi-agent AI system
- Reddit/Twitter sentiment analysis
- Advanced matchup analysis
- Real-time notifications
- League integration
- Historical performance tracking
