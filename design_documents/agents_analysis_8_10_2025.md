# Analysis of Current Agents and Their Data Requirements

## DraftPrep Agent

**Purpose**: Helps with keeper decisions, ADP analysis, and finding value picks in fantasy drafts.

**Current Data Sources**:
1. **Milvus** - `sportsbrain_players` collection (902 embeddings with duplicates)
   - Player stats (PPG, RPG, APG, etc.)
   - Fantasy metadata (ADP, keeper_round_value)
2. **Local JSON** - `fantasy_data_2024.json`
   - ADP values for ~572 players
   - Keeper round values
   - Fantasy rankings

**What it does well**:
- Keeper value analysis (e.g., "Should I keep Ja Morant in round 3?")
- Finding value picks based on ADP vs production
- Basic player comparisons

**Data gaps/needs**:
- **Draft strategies** - No data in `sportsbrain_strategies` collection
- **Punting strategies** - No category-specific build recommendations
- **Mock draft simulations** - No historical draft data
- **Projections** - Using 2023-24 stats, no 2024-25 projections

## TradeImpact Agent

**Purpose**: Analyzes how trades affect player fantasy values and team dynamics.

**Current Data Sources**:
1. **Local JSON** - `trades_2024.json`
   - Major 2023-24 trades (Porzingis, Lillard, Smart)
   - Pre-calculated impact metrics (usage rate, scoring changes)
   - Team impact assessments
2. **Milvus** - Player current stats for context

**What it does well**:
- Specific trade impact analysis (e.g., "How does Porzingis trade affect Tatum?")
- Finding trade winners/losers
- Team dynamics analysis

**Data gaps/needs**:
- **Limited trade coverage** - Only 3-4 major trades in mock data
- **No Reddit sentiment** - `sportsbrain_trades` collection empty
- **Static analysis** - Pre-calculated impacts, not dynamic
- **No real-time updates** - Can't analyze new trades

## Missing: ProjectionAnalyst Agent

This agent hasn't been implemented yet but would need:
- Historical performance data (multiple seasons)
- Age curves and development patterns
- Injury history and recovery timelines
- Sophomore/breakout candidate indicators
- Team situation changes (coaching, system)

## For Project Submission (7 days)

The current setup is **sufficient for demonstration** with some caveats:

**Strengths**:
1. Both agents work with real queries from CLAUDE.md
2. Mock data covers key demo scenarios
3. Architecture is solid (async, tool-based, coordinator pattern)

**Weaknesses to address**:
1. **Duplicate embeddings** - Clean up the 902 player records
2. **Empty collections** - Need strategy/trade embeddings for richer analysis
3. **ProjectionAnalyst** - Needs implementation for completeness

**Recommendation**: The agents are doing their job adequately with mock/partial data. For the submission, focus on:
1. Cleaning Milvus duplicates
2. Implementing ProjectionAnalyst with mock projections
3. Adding a few draft strategies to demonstrate the strategies collection
4. Ensuring all demo scenarios work smoothly
