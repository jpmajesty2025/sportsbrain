# NBA Player Risk Assessment for Fantasy Analytics

For NBA fantasy analytics, you'll want to focus on metrics that predict both performance and availability, since fantasy points mean nothing if a player doesn't play.

## Key Risk Categories to Track

### Injury Risk
- Games missed per season (historical trend)
- Injury recurrence rates by type
- Load management frequency
- Minutes restriction periods
- Age-related decline curves
- Position-specific injury patterns (centers vs guards have different risk profiles)

### Performance Volatility
- Game-to-game fantasy point variance
- Consistency scores (percentage of games within X standard deviations of mean)
- Matchup dependency (performance vs specific team defenses)
- Rest vs back-to-back performance differentials
- Home/away splits
- Month-by-month performance trends

### Usage and Role Security
- Target share volatility
- Bench time risk (coach preferences, team depth)
- Trade likelihood (contract status, team situation)
- Rookie/young player development uncertainty

## Data Sources You'll Need

### Historical Performance Data
- NBA API for basic stats, advanced metrics
- Play-by-play data for usage patterns
- Injury reports and missed games
- Minutes played and restrictions

### External Factors
- Team roster changes and depth charts
- Coaching changes and tendencies
- Schedule density (back-to-backs, road trips)
- Rest patterns and load management history

## Useful Models

### Injury Prediction
- Survival analysis models to predict time until next injury
- Classification models for injury likelihood by position/age/workload
- Time series analysis for load management patterns

### Performance Models
- Monte Carlo simulations for fantasy point distributions
- Gaussian mixture models for multi-modal performance (accounting for good/bad game clusters)
- Bayesian updating models that adjust predictions based on recent performance
- Regression models incorporating rest, matchup, and usage factors

### Ensemble Approaches
- Combine multiple risk factors into composite risk scores
- Weight models differently based on time of season and data availability
- Use machine learning to identify non-obvious risk patterns

## Implementation Strategy

Start with simpler metrics like injury history and performance variance, then layer in more sophisticated models. Focus on actionable insights - a player might be high-risk but still valuable if priced appropriately in your fantasy format.

The key is balancing predictive accuracy with interpretability, since fantasy users want to understand why a player is flagged as risky.
