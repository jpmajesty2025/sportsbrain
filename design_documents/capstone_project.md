## 📖 Introduction
The purpose of the capstone project is to allow students to apply their learning from the bootcamp in a meaningful way. This project will be a valuable addition to your GitHub portfolio when applying for jobs.

In this project, you are encouraged to find or create your own datasets and come up with original analyses. Avoid well-known datasets (like Iris, Titanic, or NYC Yellow Cab) to make your project stand out.

You may work in groups of up to 3 students.

---

## 🛠️ Steps
To structure your project, follow these steps:
1. Identify a problem you'd like to solve.
2. Scope the project and choose data sources.
3. Use at least 2 different data sources
4. Define your use cases and value your AI is providing
5. Choose your tech stack and justify your choices.
6. Explore and assess the data.
7. Identify and resolve data quality issues.
8. Document your data cleaning steps.
9. Create a system design diagram

## 📤 Project Submission Instructions
To submit your capstone project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Instead of creating a new repository, you will clone the `rag-vercel-example` repository for your capstone.
   - Repository link: [RAG Vercel Example](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/rag-vercel-example)

2. **Branch Creation**: 
   - After cloning, create a new branch for your work.
   - If working in a group, each member should create their own branch and coordinate to merge their changes into a shared team branch. **Do not merge directly to the main branch**.

3. **Deploy your code to Vercel (or other platform)**:
   - Submissions without a live like will be automatically rejected.

4. **Submission Review**:
     - Include the screenshot of your project
     - Ensure all project files and documentation are in the your repository
     - Create a zip file of your submission and submit it on the assignments page.
     - If you are working in a group, please add all your group mates names and emails on the readme.

## 📊 Rubric
To achieve an excellent score, ensure you address all rubric criteria:

### 👉 Criteria 1: Project Spec
Include:
- System/AI Agent design diagram
- Screenshots (UI, example queries)
- What business problem are you trying to solve?

### 👉 Criteria 2: Write Up
Document the project in a clear and concise way:
- Purpose of the project and expected outputs
- Dataset and technology choices, with justifications
- Steps followed and challenges faced
- Possible future enhancements

### 👉 Criteria 3: Vectorizing unstructured data
Include at least 2 data quality checks for each data source.

### 👉 Criteria 4: RAG code
Your code should use RAG model:
- Standout if you want to use Graph
- Consider adding re-ranking
- Your RAG vector database should have at least 1000 embeddings loaded
- You have to integration test your RAG with at least 5 queries
- You have to protect your RAG from abuse with some techniques

### 👉 Criteria 4: Deployed on a live site 
- You have to provide a live link to your app

### 👉 Criteria 5: Project Scoping
Your capstone must address a real, non-trivial use case, implemented end-to-end.

## 🌟 Stand Out
To make your project shine:
- Add technical complexity
  - Real-time data
  - Add analytics layer to "score" people 
  - Deeper business value 
  - Personalized experience with user authentication
- Apply advanced analytical patterns
- Use auto-prompt optimization and show the improvement
- Build a really good-looking UI
- Post your project on platforms like Kaggle or Medium for additional recognition.

---

## 📢 Publishing
Share your project and write-up on Medium, LinkedIn, or GitHub. It's a great way to build connections, gain feedback, and showcase your work.
