# SportsBrain Phase 1A Implementation Plan (Rubric-Aligned)

## Critical Requirements from Rubric

### âœ… MUST HAVE for Baseline:
1. **RAG Implementation** (Criteria 4)
   - Vector database with **1000+ embeddings**
   - Integration test with **5+ queries**
   - Protection from abuse
   - Consider re-ranking

2. **Multiple Data Sources** (Criteria 3)
   - At least 2 different sources
   - Data quality checks for each

3. **Deployed Live Site** (Criteria 4)
   - Live link required

4. **Documentation** (Criteria 1 & 2)
   - System design diagram
   - Screenshots
   - Business problem statement

### ðŸŒŸ STAND OUT Features:
- **Graph RAG** (not just vector)
- **Real-time data**
- **Analytics scoring layer**
- **Personalized with auth**
- **Auto-prompt optimization**

## Revised Phase 1A Architecture

### 1. Agentic AI System (Simplified but Real)
Instead of skipping agents entirely, implement 2-3 focused agents:

```python
# Phase 1A Agents
1. StatsAnalyzer Agent
   - Queries vector DB of player stats
   - Uses RAG to find similar players
   - Provides stat-based recommendations

2. MatchupAdvisor Agent  
   - Queries graph DB of team matchups
   - Analyzes defensive ratings
   - Provides matchup-based insights

3. PersonalAssistant Agent (Coordinator)
   - Routes queries to appropriate agent
   - Combines responses
   - Handles user context
```

### 2. Dual RAG Implementation

#### Vector RAG (1000+ embeddings)
```
Data Sources:
- Player stats (season averages, last 10 games)
- Player profiles (play style, strengths)
- Historical performance patterns

Embeddings:
- 30 teams Ã— 15 players Ã— 3 embedding types = 1,350 embeddings
```

#### Graph RAG (Stand Out!)
```
Relationships:
- Player â†’ Team
- Team â†’ Opponent
- Player â†’ Historical Matchup Performance
- Player â†’ Similar Players (by style)
```

### 3. Data Sources (2+ Required)

1. **NBA Stats API** (Real-time - Stand Out!)
   - Live game stats
   - Player/team statistics
   - Data quality: Check for nulls, validate ranges

2. **Reddit r/fantasybball** (Community Sentiment)
   - Daily discussion threads
   - Player sentiment analysis
   - Data quality: Filter spam, normalize text

3. **ESPN/Yahoo Fantasy** (Optional 3rd source)
   - Ownership percentages
   - Expert rankings

### 4. Abuse Protection
- Rate limiting (10 queries/minute)
- User authentication required
- Query complexity limits
- Caching frequent queries

## Example Queries for Testing (5+ Required)

1. "Who should I start between LeBron and Giannis against tough defenses?"
2. "Find me consistent scorers who perform well on back-to-backs"
3. "Which point guards have the best matchup this week?"
4. "Show me undervalued players similar to Jayson Tatum"
5. "What does Reddit think about Luka's injury status?"

## Stand Out Implementation

### 1. Real-time Updates
- WebSocket for live game updates
