# SportsBrain Data Gap Analysis

## Current State (After Running player_loader.py)

### What We Have:
1. **Player Embeddings in Milvus**
   - One embedding per player (based on stats + playing style description)
   - Fields: player_name, position, text description, metadata (stats, team, etc.)
   - ~450 embeddings for all active players (or subset with --limit)

2. **Graph Relationships in Neo4j**
   - Player nodes with basic properties
   - Team nodes 
   - PLAYS_FOR relationships (Player → Team)

### What We Can Query Now:
- Find players by description similarity ("elite scorer", "three-point shooter")
- Get players by team
- Get players by position
- Basic fantasy relevance (calculated from stats)

## Gaps for Phase 1A Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Should I keep Ja Morant in round 3?"
**Need:**
- ❌ ADP (Average Draft Position) data
- ❌ Keeper round values
- ❌ Injury history/status
- ❌ Year-over-year performance trends

### Scenario 2: "How does Porzingis trade affect Tatum?"
**Need:**
- ❌ Trade event data in sportsbrain_trades collection
- ❌ Usage rate projections
- ❌ Team dynamics/chemistry analysis
- ❌ Historical performance with/without teammates

### Scenario 3: "Find me sleepers like last year's Sengun"
**Partially Supported:**
- ✅ Can find similar players via vector similarity
- ❌ Need year-over-year improvement data
- ❌ Need "breakout" indicators
- ❌ Need historical context ("last year's Sengun")

### Scenario 4: "Best punt FT% build around Giannis"
**Need:**
- ❌ Strategy embeddings in sportsbrain_strategies collection
- ❌ Category correlations (FT% impact on other cats)
- ❌ Team building/synergy analysis
- ❌ Punt strategy guides

### Scenario 5: "Which sophomores will break out?"
**Need:**
- ❌ Player experience/year identification
- ❌ Rookie → Sophomore progression patterns
- ❌ Historical breakout player embeddings
- ❌ Age and development curves

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Testing (With Current Data)
Run the test script to validate basic functionality:
```bash
cd backend/scripts
python load_data.py --players --limit 10
python test_player_queries.py
```

Expected results:
- Vector search should return relevant players
- Graph queries should show player-team relationships
- Combined queries should work

### 2. Priority Data Additions for Demo

**High Priority:**
1. **Mock Draft/ADP Data**
   - Add ADP field to player metadata
   - Create keeper value calculations
   
2. **Trade News Collection**
   - Populate sportsbrain_trades with off-season moves
   - Link trades to affected players in Neo4j

3. **Strategy Collection**
   - Create punt strategy embeddings
   - Add category correlation data

**Medium Priority:**
1. **Player Classification**
   - Add rookie/sophomore/veteran tags
   - Add year-over-year stats

2. **Reddit Sentiment**
   - Integrate r/fantasybball discussions
   - Link sentiment to players

### 3. Enhanced Player Loader
Consider enhancing the loader to:
- Add multiple embedding types per player (stats, style, projection)
- Include historical performance data
- Add player similarity relationships in Neo4j
- Include injury history and status

## Validation Approach

Even with limited data (10 players), we can validate:
1. **Vector Search Quality**: Do similar players group together?
2. **Graph Traversal**: Can we navigate relationships?
3. **Combined Queries**: Can we merge vector + graph results?
4. **Performance**: Are queries fast enough (<1.5s)?

This incremental approach lets us validate the architecture while identifying specific data needs for each demo scenario.
